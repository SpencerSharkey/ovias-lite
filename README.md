Ovias
=====

A Garry's Mod RTS [framework?], but this is not completed by any means.

Some interesting things included in this "dump":
- RTS Camera using `entity driving`. Fully predicted on client + server, making cheating harder.
- Maths for screen->world pos using custom CalcView
- 100% LUA-based `area of influence` code, based on ray-traced boundaries.
- Module-based gamemode framework, with autoloader and the like.
- `Building` and `Unit` frameworks, to add to the gamemode.
- `NextBot` unit base, allows for engine-level pathfinding and obstruction avoidance.
- Factions, I think?
- Networking framework?

Again, this stuff is all unfinished. I decided to pick this project up again but have not decided whether or not to open-source my most recent additions. In the spirit of open-source, I decided to fork this over to ovias-lite and keep what exists open to everyone.
